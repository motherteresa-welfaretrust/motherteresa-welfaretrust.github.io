We do not think of ourselves as an orphanage but as a family, bonded with love and care. We dream of a time when all children have a happy childhood, when all of them have a good education. And with the grace of Almighty, we are taking little steps everyday in that direction.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Our doors are open for everyone seeking help. Besides the shelter home, we carry on multiple initiatives like providing free legal counselling, supporting social entrepreneurship, raising awareness on government policies and RTI, working for rural and tribal upliftment, supporting for women's empowerment and education.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"About"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
